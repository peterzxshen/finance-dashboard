# finance-dashboard
Hello! This is a small data visualization project that I worked on that was based off my own finances for the month. 
The interactive visualisation shows the amount of money that I had saved, as well as demonstrating key insights to how much I made and spent within the month of June. 

Improvements to be made for the future: 
- Increase the timespan to generate greater insights
- Automate the process to add every new transaction made (utilise an API)
